# 🌿 Soil Moisture Comparison System


## 📌 Overview
The Soil Moisture Comparison System is an AI-enhanced smart agriculture solution that integrates visual analysis via smartphone with real-time sensor data from ESP32. A plant image is captured using a smartphone, then analyzed using Google’s Gemini model to estimate the visual soil moisture range. This estimated value is sent to Blynk IoT, where it's compared with live readings from an LM393 soil moisture sensor connected to ESP32. Based on this comparison, the system provides a feedback result: Wet, Moist, or Dry, enabling smarter irrigation decisions.


## ⚙️ Features
✅ AI-Powered Moisture Estimation – Uses Gemini model to predict moisture from plant images.
✅ Real-Time Sensor Reading – ESP32 with LM393 sensor provides live soil moisture data.
✅ Blynk IoT Integration – Both estimated and actual values displayed remotely.
✅ Visual-Sensor Comparison – Compares estimated range vs actual reading.
✅ Smart Feedback – Classifies the result as Wet, Moist, or Dry.
✅ Mobile-Based Workflow – Works with smartphone and ESP32.
✅ Expandable Design – Ready for integration with auto-watering or alert systems..

## 🛠️ Components Used
- ESP32 microcontroller
- LM393 Soil Moisture Sensor
- Smartphone (for plant image capture)
- Blynk IoT app
- Wi-Fi Connectivity

## 🔧 Software Requirements
ESP32:
- Arduino IDE
- Blynk Library
- Wi-Fi configuration
- Analog data reading from sensor
## Smartphone:
Google Gemini API access

## 📚 Required Libraries
ESP32 (Arduino):
  -WiFi.h
  -BlynkSimpleEsp32.h
  -ADC (for analog reads)


## 📲 Usage Flow
1. Soil Moisture Sensor (ESP32)
- Reads soil value from LM393
- Sends data to Blynk (e.g., V0)
2. Smartphone Workflow
- Captures plant image
- Uses Gemini model to estimate moisture range (e.g., 250–400)
- Sends estimated value to Blynk (e.g., V1)
3. Comparison Logic (Python)
- Fetches actual (V0) and estimated (V1) values from Blynk
- Compares both
- Displays classification result:
  -Dry: Both low
  -Moist: Within 100-unit threshold
  -Wet: Both high or visually wet but sensor dry

## 📊 Performance & Testing
