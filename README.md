ðŸŒ¿ Soil Moisture Comparison System


This project combines a **soil moisture sensor** using ESP32 and **plant health detection from images** using Raspberry Pi or a smartphone. It compares both results and sends updates to the Blynk IoT app.

## ðŸ”§ Components Used

- **ESP32** microcontroller
- **LM393 Soil Moisture Sensor**
- **Raspberry Pi 4** (or any computer with Python & OpenCV)
- **Blynk IoT** app (for real-time monitoring)
- **Mobile Camera** (for plant image capture)
